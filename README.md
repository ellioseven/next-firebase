# Next.js + Firebase Testing Strategies

An example application illustrating unit and integration testing strategies for Next.js + Firebase (Firestore & Functions) applications. Serves as a starter for TDD workflows for modern applications. Also lends itself to a highly efficient local development environment for Next.js + Firebase applications.

Example application implements a simple user generated score board, where users
can enter their scores and view a generated leaderboard. The application is powered by Next.js, Firestore and Firebase Functions.

Heavily relies on Docker and Firebase emulators to simulate virtual production environment.
